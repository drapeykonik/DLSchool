# Deep Learning School Course #
In this repository all DLS Course materials are stored. 
## Description ##
This course is about PyTorch and neural networks basics. Covers fully-connected, convolution neural networks (for classification, semantic segmantation and detection), autoencoders and GANs, theirs different architectures and their application to different tasks (MNIST classification, CIFAR10 classification, Simpsons classification, handwritten digits generating, people faces generating and etc.)
> There are IPython Notebooks in this repository mostly. If GitHub render doesn't work, please, use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/) to see notebooks
